# How to run this program on your system
## There are a few methods that you can use

#Method 1 - Using Online C++ Compiler
-> First the simplest way to use this C++ program is to simply select the entire code and then copy it and paste in an online C++ compiler of your choice or you can go with my choice that is simply follow this link -> https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
once you have pasted the entire code there then click on "Run" button and follow the instructions in the terminal to execute the code.

#Method 2 - Using C++ compiler on your system and a code editor
-> Make sure your compiler executable is in your platform path (%PATH on Windows, $PATH on Linux and macOS) so that the C/C++ extension can find it. You can check availability of your C++ tools by opening the Integrated Terminal (Ctrl+`) in VS Code and trying to directly run the compiler.
Checking for the GCC compiler g++:
g++ --version
Checking for the Clang compiler clang:
clang --version
This C++ program will encrypt or decrypt the code with the help of a key provided as input.

## If you don't have a compiler installed, in the example below, we describe how to install the Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW) C++ tools (compiler and debugger). MinGW is a popular, free toolset for Windows. If you are running VS Code on another platform, you can read the C++ tutorials, which cover C++ configurations for Linux and macOS.

If you want to download and install MinGWx64 on your system then visit this website for detailed steps to install and run the code on your system
